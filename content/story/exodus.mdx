eyebrow: Chapter I
description: The moment the persona steps into the light and the audience hears the first pulse.

The Performa begins in the dark, a bass tone rolling like fog across the floor. The first pulse is not a song yet; it's a ritual. A signal that the room is about to be transformed into a venue for catharsis.

Exodus is the threshold moment. The set opens with minimal instrumentation and a tightening loop, letting the crowd's anticipation rise. Visuals stay restrained, silhouetted, metallic, and slowly warming.

By the end of the chapter, the pulse becomes a full rhythm. The stage becomes a horizon.
