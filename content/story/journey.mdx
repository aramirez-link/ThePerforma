Journey is movement. The groove opens, and the show stretches across tempo shifts and live instrumentation. This is the set's longest arc, designed to keep the crowd traveling without losing momentum.

The chapter is structured in movements, each one building toward a drop that feels cinematic rather than aggressive. Visuals push outward into warm gold, deep red, and a shimmer of strobe. The energy is kinetic and communal.

When Journey closes, the audience feels like they've traveled far, and the room feels larger.
